Sideprojectbot is a simple side project tracker that I created to help track Rails personal projects I am working on. It was inspired by iDoneThis.com and by the fact that Gmail, Google docs, Evernote, excel documents, and a notebook did not meet my needs.

Sideprojectbot is simple. It lets you create projects, add ideas/tasks to them like a to-do list, and mark those tasks as completed when they are done.

It will use Devise, Bootstrap and Postgresql.
